### Examples

#### Example 1 - Simulating a species tree and the genomes ####

First thing we do is we are going to change the parameters of the Species Tree.
 For that we create a new file using:

     mkdir ./EXAMPLE_1
     cp ./Parameters/SpeciesTreeParameters.tsv ./EXAMPLE_1/SpeciesTreeParameters.tsv

By default (STOPPING_RULE = 0), the tree evolves until time reaches TOTAL_TIME
Let us change this to obtain a tree with 6 living lineages. We open the file and we modify:

 * STOPPING_RULE = 3
 * N_LINEAGES = 6

To make the example reproducible, let us also change the seed.

* SEED = 237

Let us also use change the default and extinction rates. For that, we will use as the speciation rate: 3 * 10^4
and as extinction rate 1 * 10^-4

For that we make SPECIATION_P0 = 0.0003 and EXTINCTION_P0 = 0.0001. Once we have changed that, we can run the command

     python3 simuLyon.py T ./EXAMPLE_1/SpeciesTreeParameters.tsv ./EXAMPLE_1

 Then we can go to the folder /EXAMPLE_1 and inspect the files that have been created there.

 The resulting tree has 6 extant lineages and it can be found in the file /EXAMPLE_1/WholeTree
 The surviving species can be found in /EXAMPLE1/ExtantTree

Once that we have computed a species tree, we can simulate **the evolution of genomes** inside this species tree. We will change the default parameters.

     cp ./Parameters/GenomeParameters.tsv  ./EXAMPLE_1/GenomeParameters.tsv

First, we are going to use the SEED = 237 to have reproducible results.

Second, we will make STEM_FAMILIES = 100. This makes the genome of the root to be composed of 100 gene families ordered in a circle

Third, we are going to make inversions and translocations to affect large sections of the genome. For that we will change:

TRANSLOCATION_E = 0.05
INVERSION_E = 0.05

After that we launch simuLyon using the command

     python3 simuLyon.py G ./EXAMPLE_1/GenomeParameters.tsv ./EXAMPLE_1

Once that we have computed gene trees, we can simulate DNA and amino-acid sequences of each gene inside this species tree.
We will not change the default parameters set to simulate DNA sequences.

     cp ./Parameters/SequenceParameters.tsv ./EXAMPLE_1/SequenceParameters.tsv
     python3 simuLyon.py S ./EXAMPLE_1/SequenceParameters.tsv ./EXAMPLE_1/
